# Physics-411
Final Project: The final project of this course encompassed every aspect of the course itself.
This final project demonstrates a strong foundation in data science and time series analysis.
The code was tailored to look better for github and thus some of the graphs are slightly different than that which was pushed for a deadline in a final project
:)
